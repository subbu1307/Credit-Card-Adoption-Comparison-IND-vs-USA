# 💳 Credit Card Adoption and Usage: Insights from US & India

## 📚 About the Project

This project explores credit card adoption and spending patterns in the **United States** and **India** from **January 2019 to June 2020**. Using visual analytics and multiple socioeconomic datasets, we examine how **income, education, unemployment, age**, and **gender** impact credit card behavior. The analysis offers insights for policymakers, financial institutions, and credit issuers to better understand consumer credit trends and enhance financial inclusion.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze U.S. credit card usage across demographic and geographic dimensions.
- Compare spending behavior between the U.S. and India using purchasing power parity (PPP).
- Identify how income, education, and employment affect credit card fraud and adoption.
- Offer actionable recommendations for stakeholders to promote responsible credit use.
